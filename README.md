# Digital Identity Credential Issuer

# di-ipv-cri-kbv-front

Frontend for the Knowledge Based Verification Credential Issuer

This is the home for the front end user interface for a credential issuer as a part of the Identity Proofing and Verification (IPV) system within the GDS digital identity platform. Other repositories are used for core services or other credential issuers.

# Installation

Clone this repository and then run

```bash
yarn install
```

## Environment Variables

- 'BASE_URL': Externally accessible base url of the webserver. Used to generate the callback url as part of credential issuer oauth flows
- `PORT` - Default port to run webserver on. (Default to `5020`)

# Mock Data

[Wiremock](https://wiremock.org/) has been used to create a [stateful mock](https://wiremock.org/docs/stateful-behaviour/) of the API, through the use of scenarios. These configuration files are stored as JSON files in the [./test/mocks/mappings](./test/mocks/mappings) directory.

This can be run by using:

`yarn run mock`

The frontend can be configured to use this mock server through two environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV = development` - this enables a middleware that passes the `x-scenario-id` header from web requests through to the API
- `API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:8090` - this points the frontend at the Wiremock instance

A browser extension, such as [Mod Header](https://modheader.com/), can be used to set the value of this header in a web browser.

# Request properties

In order to support consistent use of headers for API requests, [middleware](./src/lib/axios) is applied to add an instance of
[axios](https://axios-http.com/) on each request onto `req.axios`. This is then reused in any code that uses the API.
